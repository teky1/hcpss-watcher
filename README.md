# hcpss-watcher
A super jank script I threw together in under 5 minutes to poll the HCPSS status website to see if there were any changes (such as a snow day being declared)

warning: there will definitely be false alarms because the script reports a change anytime anything changes on the HCPSS status website which could include just them fixing a type or something
